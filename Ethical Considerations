Ethical Considerations – post project completion

The ethical considerations in this project can be quite extensive depending on the use of its work. We scraped our data from 
EarthExplorer’s API. For the scope of this project we haven’t pulled large amounts of files as each one requires a lot of processing to
analyse. However if scaled up, some people may find it intrusive that you are collecting images of private property, and methods should
be implemented into taking away images if requested by individuals.

People relevant to the project include the local communities and services that could benefit from the work (e.g. firefighting services).
Given the focus of the project, it aligns quite well with their goals as well. It could provide useful information and protect local
communities. It can also be used as a quick alarm system to quickly alert local communities of danger.

If this project were to be extended, it could be set up to alert any nearby homes if it detects fire or connected to a text alert system
in place. For this, a very high level of accuracy would need to be achieved as it could send out false alarms or even worse, not detect
fire when it is present. 

Secondly, it may be useful in counties with less capable infrastructure or with large areas needing to be covered without needing for
people present.

Given the nature of this work, for it to be extended you would need it to have near perfect results, which can be difficult given the 
difficulties, however it could prove to be very useful if achieved.
